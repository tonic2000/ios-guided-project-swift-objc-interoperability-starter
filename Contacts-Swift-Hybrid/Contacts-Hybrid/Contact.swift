    // Why did I make this a class ?
    // ContactModelController -> Objective- C
    // Conllection (NSArray) of contacts ?
    // Can I use a primitive data type in Objective-C
    
    // Swift struct is not supported in Objective - C
    // You can't put a Swift struct into an NSArray class
    // Must subclass from NSObject to use in Objective- C
    
    // Swift enum with associated values are also not supported in ObjC
